        I recall first smelling Versace The Dreamer fresh from the atomizer and thinking it smelt amazing. I then sprayed it on my forearm. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy that opening. The pungent tobacco was simply unpleasant. But I ended up purchasing a bottle since I enjoyed the long dry down so much.

        Fast forward to the moment I first smelled this and fell in love (opening and all). While it isn't a perfect duplicate of The Dreamer, it does embody the greatest qualities of it in its own perfume. I'm sure Signature draws inspiration from other smells as well (certainly from Le Male), but I prefer to think of it as the perfume I've always wanted from The Dreamer. The aroma itself is rich on lavender and sandalwood. I see why people have likened it to soap or detergent, but I believe that's a little limiting.

        I also got great longevity, despite maybe overspraying it by one or two sprays. After around 6 hours, I was definitely still smelling it, although it was quite near to my skin at that time. Love all around for me. I honestly can't get enough of it.
